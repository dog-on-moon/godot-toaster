# Toaster - see more: [moonSuite](https://dog-game.xyz/tools/)

Toaster is an extremely advanced cooking mechanism for Godot 4.4+ designed to fully utilize the new EditorToaster system exposed in Godot 4.4dev5.
This plugin is created based on what I felt was lacking from Godot in regards to efficient toast development, and I hope it will serve your purposes too.

## üçû toaster

Godot Toaster integrates a brand new Toaster tab into the bottom dock. At any time, you can open it up to begin cooking Toast. Several cooking options are presented for your cooking leisure, along with an advanced integrated terminal dedicated for revealing what's going on inside the toaster.

## Documentation

Toaster is currently lacking documentation.

## Installation

This repository contains the plugin. Note that Godot v4.4dev5 is required, even though it's not released yet. Fortunately, I am a time traveller. Copy the contents of the `addons` folder into the `addons` folder in your own Godot project.
